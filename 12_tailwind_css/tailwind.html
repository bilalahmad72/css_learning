A) First Way to use CDN for tailwind 

Tailwind can be inject by using this script => 
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

( but the problem is that its will not give suggestions of tailwind classes ). 


B)  Second way to use the extension and some software installation

First of all need to install the tailwind extension in VS Code or in your other code editor to get the suggestion of tailwind classes.

Installation of software and Tailwind CLI into the project, here are the steps:

1) node js

check in terminal by running  ( node -v , npm -v )

2) go to the https://tailwindcss.com and check the documentation of Tailwind CLI.

3) open the terminal and run this command => 

npm install -D tailwindcss 

( -D mean is that for developer mode )

4) then run this command 

npx tailwindcss init

these commands will auto generate some files into the project folder,

5) open the " tailwind.config.css " file and do some settings 

6) then replace the => content: [] with this

content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],

its mean that under the home directory there is src folder and under that folder any file with extension html and js can follow this. 

7) under the src folder create a new file " input.css "

8) under input.css file put these lines

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

this will gives the warning at @tailwind we can ignore this in VS Code 

9) then run this command 

npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch

its will auto generate a new file with " output.css " name.


10) then under the index.html file of our project should need to add this link => 

<link href="./output.css" rel="stylesheet">

in this way the tailwind and its all classes will be working in project.
